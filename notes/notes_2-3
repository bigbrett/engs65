Postfix (polish) notation: 
10 12 +  // 10+12
6 8 9 + * // 6 * (8+9)

Theme: As soon as you hit an operator, treat the previous two arguments as tthe operands: THIS EMPLOYS A STACK

Stack S; 
	loop until input empty; 
	symbol = get next input; 
	if (sybol != operand) then S.push(symbol); 
	else {
		op2 = s.pop();
		op1 = s.pop(); 
		r = op1 (symbol) op2; 
		s.push(r); 
	}

things to check: 
	make sure the stack has at least 2 elements in it before the operator
	make sure the stack is empty at the end
	
TEST QUESTION: 
	what happens when you have a copy constructor where the argument doesn't have an ampersand
		stack(stack S) // as opposed to stack(stack &S) 
			It keeps copying itself and pushing itself onto the stack to make another copy
